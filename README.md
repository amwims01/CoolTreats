# CoolTreats
My project
This is the final. I did have committed changes throughout the project; however, due to technical difficulties with GitHub, the mentors suggested that I delete my previous committed files. 
In this repository you will find information on Cool Treats which includes html, css, and javascript. Thank you for a great program! I enjoyed creating my fun website.
